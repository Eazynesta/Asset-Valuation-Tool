# Asset-Valuation-Tool
The Sovren Valuation Tool evaluates a symbol's relative strength against up to three reference symbols, normalizing the data over a user-defined lookback period. It visually plots normalized values on a scale of 0-100, helping traders assess market positioning and potential reversals using multiple asset comparisons.
